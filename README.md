# Smart_Deal_AI
SmartDeal AI is an experimental project that tracks and predicts product prices using real e-commerce data. it scrapes prices from sites like Trendyol, Hepsiburada, and Amazon, cleans and stores them, then applies machine learning models to forecast future price movements and computes RMSE for evaluation, and suggests “buy now” or “wait” decisions.
